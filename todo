- how can we translate alloy's solution to a test case? 
this of course depends on the platform. 
- support analysis functions and relations: if a name is not a state variable and it is not a constant (that is, it is not appear in an equality expression with a state variable) then we assume that it is a modeling variable.
- activate alloy from wpca and display the result in a way that is meaningful to the author of the program.

 (_, Just hout, _, _) <- createProcess (proc "ls" []){ std_out = CreatePipe }
hGetContents hout

done

- put parenthesis around expressions 
- move project to github
- read from file
- create configuration file to guide translation?
- need to control: scope, sat solver, platform, name of analysis file, should analysis file be kept or deleted, 
- given platform need to control:
-  name of file,procedure,class,method, package and so on
